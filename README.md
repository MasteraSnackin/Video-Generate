```javascript
console.log("Starting image-to-video generation...");
let generation = await client.generations.create({
    prompt: "A captivating image of a character dancing joyfully in the rain, set against a moody yet vibrant backdrop. The scene is illuminated by soft, diffused light breaking through stormy clouds, creating a magical atmosphere. The character is dressed in flowing, wet clothing that clings to their form, emphasizing movement and texture. Raindrops splash dynamically around them, with puddles reflecting the muted colours of the sky. Their pose is graceful and expressive, arms outstretched and feet mid-step as they twirl or leap with abandon. The environment is rich with detail—perhaps a cobblestone street or a lush grassy field—with water droplets glistening on surfaces. The mood is uplifting and cinematic, evoking freedom and connection to nature. Style: hyper-realistic or painterly (depending on preference), high resolution, intricate detail",
    keyframes: {
      frame0: {
        type: "image",
        url: "https://images.lifestyleasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/28140402/MNT-1600x900.jpg"
      }
    }
    // You can add other options here like model, resolution, duration, etc.
    // model: "ray-2", // Example: Use Ray 2 model

    // duration: "5s"
